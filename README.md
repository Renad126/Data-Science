## Installation 

1. Python 3
2. Libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, sklearn and matplotlib.

## Project Motivation 

This entire project is part of a Data Scientist Nanodegree Program by Udacity.
Using Mall-Customer-Segmentation data I have tried to answer the following questions to provide a comprehensive understanding of customer segmentation based on annual income, spending score, and gender.

1. What is the relationship between Annual Income and Spending Score?
2. Which cluster is the largest in the dataset?
3. How is gender distributed across each cluster?


## File Descriptions

There is one Jupyter Notebook file that contains all the analytics, codes Markdown cells and comments.

## Results

You can find brief results below, for more detailed answers please refer to my [blog post]: 

[blog post]: 

1. What is the relationship between Annual Income and Spending Score?
There are five customer segments based on their annual income and spending score.
The data can be roughly categorized into five clusters:

-  low income, low spending score
-  low income, high spending score
-  oderate income, moderate spending score
-  high income, low spending score
-  high income, high spending score
  
2. Which cluster is the largest in the dataset?
- Cluster 3 is the biggest one with 32.5%

3. How is gender distributed across each cluster?
- Distribution of gender to recognize different distributions
